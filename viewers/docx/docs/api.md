# Element API and events

Every framework adapter wraps the same `<docx-editor>` custom element. The adapters forward these properties and re-emit these events in their framework's idiom (see [framework bindings](/bindings)).

## Attributes and properties

| Property         | Attribute         | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `documentModel`  |                   | The `DocumentModel` shown. Assigning it is an external replacement, not an edit event.       |
| `readOnly`       | `read-only`       | Blocks local edits. Remote collaboration batches still apply.                                |
| `locale`         | `locale`          | Interface language: `en`, `fr`, `de`, `es` or `zh-CN`. Document content is never translated. |
| `fileName`       | `file-name`       | Name of the open document (default `Document1.docx`).                                        |
| `reviewAuthor`   | `review-author`   | Author recorded on tracked changes and comments (default `Author`).                          |
| `theme`          | `theme`           | `light`, `dark` or `auto`. See [theming](/theming).                                          |
| `themeColors`    |                   | Partial token overrides applied as `--dve-*` custom properties.                              |
| `showThumbnails` | `show-thumbnails` | Left rail of page thumbnails (Print Layout only).                                            |
| `showToolbar`    | `show-toolbar`    | `false` hides the ribbon; the title bar and status bar remain.                               |
| `hiddenActions`  |                   | Ribbon controls to hide by stable id; see the table in [bindings](/bindings).                |
| `dirty` (read)   |                   | True after an edit, false after save, load or `markClean()`.                                 |

## Methods

| `save()`                                              | Resolves to a `Blob` of the serialized document.                               |
| `saveBytes()`                                         | Resolves to the raw `Uint8Array`.                                              |

| `receiveCollaboration(batch)`                         | Apply an accepted batch from the authority.                                    |
| `stopCollaboration(discardPending?)`                  | Leave the session; pending edits must be acknowledged or explicitly discarded. |
| `publishPresence`, `receivePresence`, `leavePresence` | Transient presence channel; see [collaboration](/collaboration#presence).      |

## Events

All events bubble and are composed, so they cross the shadow boundary.
