## Why ooxml?

- **Everything runs client-side.** Files never leave the user's machine: no Office install, no conversion service, no native binaries. The same library runs in browsers, Node.js, Bun, workers and serverless functions.
- **One model for every format.** Word, PowerPoint, Excel and Visio share one XML model, packaging layer, units, colours and geometry. Each format is an area of one package, not a dependency to keep in step.
- **Round-trips without losing what it does not understand.** Untouched parts stay byte-for-byte, unknown markup is preserved, and edits that would damage unsupported content are rejected instead of silently dropped.
- **Real editors, not only viewers.** Ribbons, grids, a formula engine (480+ functions), undo and redo, find and replace and real-time co-editing over Yjs, as web components with thin bindings for React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid and plain JavaScript.
- **Password-protected and legacy files.** Open and save ECMA-376 encrypted packages, and read legacy `.doc`, `.xls` and `.ppt` through the sibling [`ole2`](https://github.com/ChristopherVR/ole2) codecs.
- **AI ready.** MCP servers let Claude, Cursor and other agents read and edit documents through the same code the editors use.
- **Honest about its limits.** Unsupported features are reported, never hidden, and nothing here claims Office parity or lossless export without evidence.

## Quick start

**Headless: open a Word document, change it, save it**

```ts
import { loadDocx } from 'ooxml-core/docx';

const loaded = await loadDocx(bytes); // Uint8Array | ArrayBuffer
loaded.model.blocks; // paragraphs and tables
const edited = await loaded.save(); // original package parts are preserved
```

**An editor in your app (React shown; every framework has the same shape)**

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { createDocument, WordEditor } from 'docx-react-viewer';

export function Editor() {
	const [model, setModel] = useState(() => createDocument());
	return <WordEditor documentModel={model} onDocumentChange={setModel} />;
}
```

Each product's README has the snippet for every framework: [Word](../viewers/docx#readme), [Excel](../viewers/xlsx#readme), [Visio](../viewers/visio#readme) and [OpenTeams](../viewers/teams#readme). The library's areas and API are in the [`ooxml-core` README](../src/core#readme), and the [MCP server](../mcp#readme) has its own setup.

## How it fits together

```
pptx-*-viewer       ┐
docx-*-viewer       │
xlsx-*-viewer       │  framework bindings: lifecycle and events only
visio-*-viewer      ├── ooxml-ui ──┐   Lit web components: ribbons, grids, dialogs (DOM only)
openteams-*-viewer  ┘              │
                                   ├── ooxml-core ──┬── ole2 (legacy binary codecs)
ooxml-mcp ─────────────────────────┘   (all logic)   ├── emf-converter
                                                      └── mtx-decompressor
```

- **`ooxml-core`** owns the logic: packaging, XML, every format's model, parser, writer and editing commands, layout, validation and collaboration. It has no UI.
- **`ooxml-ui`** owns the DOM: the shared elements and the product editors as `ooxml-ui/<product>` subpaths. The core never imports it.
- **Viewers** own only the framework bindings, demos, end-to-end tests and docs. They never copy logic from the library.

## What is in this repository

The logic of every Office product lives in this repository, and so do the interfaces for PowerPoint, Word, Excel, Visio and OpenTeams. They are all members of one Bun workspace with one lockfile. Each folder below links to its own README.

</details>

The viewers keep only what is specific to a framework: the bindings, demos, end-to-end tests and docs. Format logic stays in `src/core/`, and a viewer must not copy it.

## Fidelity and compatibility

These are early implementations. They are approximations of the Office applications, not parity, and saving is not lossless for content a model does not cover. Features a product does not support are reported rather than hidden, and each viewer's docs list its known gaps ([Word](https://christophervr.github.io/ooxml/docx/), [Excel](https://christophervr.github.io/ooxml/xlsx/features), [Visio](https://christophervr.github.io/ooxml/visio/)). The [roadmap](../docs/roadmap.md) says what comes next.

## Development

You need [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and Node.js 22 or newer. One install at the root sets up the library, the UI and every viewer.

```bash
bun install
bun run typecheck      # strict project and the pptx project
bun run test           # the library's unit tests
bun run build          # the library
bun run test:package   # packs the build and imports every entry point from a clean install
```

The viewers resolve `ooxml-ui` to the copy in this workspace through its built `dist`, so build the library and the UI before working on one:

```bash
bun run build && bun run --cwd src/ui build
cd viewers/docx        # or pptx, xlsx, visio, teams
bun run typecheck && bun run test
bun run demo           # docx, xlsx: the demo app (visio, teams: bun run dev)
```

Each viewer has its own scripts and browser tests; the root `typecheck`, `test`, `fmt` and `lint` do not cover `viewers/`. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) decides from the files a change touches what to run, including which viewers to verify.

Releases are automated. Every published package has its own version and tag (`<npm-name>@<version>`), planned from conventional commits, with changelogs and npm publishing through trusted publishing (OIDC, with provenance). See [docs/releasing.md](../docs/releasing.md). Commits must follow [Conventional Commits](../CONTRIBUTING.md), and nobody publishes or tags by hand.

The working agreements are in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), and [PROVENANCE.md](../PROVENANCE.md) records where each module came from.

- [OOXML Office](https://christophervr.github.io/ooxml/): the suite's launcher page (`site/`). It opens the demos of every viewer, all built into the same site.
- [ole2](https://github.com/ChristopherVR/ole2): the compound-file container and legacy binary Office codecs.
- [emf-converter](https://github.com/ChristopherVR/emf-converter) and [mtx-decompressor](https://github.com/ChristopherVR/mtx-decompressor): EMF/WMF rendering and embedded-font (MicroType Express) decompression, used by the library.
